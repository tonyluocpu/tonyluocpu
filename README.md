# Hi! I'm Tony 👋

Data Science/Economics student at UChicago passionate about **data analytics**, **data visualization**, **workflow automation**, and **AI agents**. 

Currently focused on building intelligent systems that scale—from automating data pipelines processing 56M+ records to developing conversational AI agents. I combine statistical rigor with engineering to solve real-world problems in both academic research and industry settings.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, C, SQL (DuckDB, MS SQL Server), R

**Data & ML:** Pandas, Polars, NumPy | TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn | Tableau, Plotly

**Tools:** Git, Docker, AWS/Azure/Google Cloud, Cursor, DuckDB

## 🚀 Featured Work
- **AI Agents:** Building conversational systems (stock analysis, creative writing)
- **Data Pipelines:** Scaled fuzzy matching + API workflows handling millions of records
- **ML Research:** Geospatial machine learning for risk modeling & drug discovery

## 📌 Current Focus
- Optimizing ML workflows on HPC clusters
- Applying ML to biomedical research (organoid viability prediction)
- Trading & financial data analysis
