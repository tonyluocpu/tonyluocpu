# Hi! I'm Tony 👋

Data Science/Economics student at UChicago passionate about **data analytics**, **data visualization**, **workflow automation**, and **AI agents**. 

I've built intelligent systems at scale—including data pipelines processing 56M+ records and conversational AI agents. I combine statistical rigor with engineering to solve real-world problems in both academic research and industry settings.

## Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, C, SQL (DuckDB, MS SQL Server), R

**Data & ML:** Pandas, Polars, NumPy | TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn | Tableau, Plotly

**Tools:** Git, Docker, AWS/Azure/Google Cloud, Cursor, DuckDB

## Featured Projects

### AI & Automation
- **[Stock Agent](https://github.com/tonyluocpu/stock-agent)** - Conversational agent that scrapes time-series stock data from major trading platforms, performs NLP-based retrieval at multiple frequencies, and provides basic stock analysis with accuracy evaluation.

- **[Fiction Writer](https://github.com/tonyluocpu/fiction-writer)** - Interactive text-editor agent that generates new story chapters through qualitative and quantitative analysis of input texts.

### Data Science & ML Research
- **[CVD-ML-project](https://github.com/tonyluocpu/CVD-ML-project)** - Machine learning models for cardiovascular disease research and risk analysis.

- **[Promega](https://github.com/tonyluocpu/Promega)** *(Private, public release Q4 2026)* - Building ML models for organoid viability prediction using computer vision and deep learning. Developing methods to incorporate baseline measurements for earlier prediction modeling.

### Academic Projects
- **Blokus Game** - Strategic board game implementation with game logic and AI opponents.

- **ConnectM** - Interactive dropping pieces game with bot AI and both terminal and GUI interfaces.

## Current Focus

**Promega Project:**
- Optimizing ML workflows on HPC clusters
- Applying ML to biomedical research (organoid viability prediction)

**Stock Agent:**
- Trading & financial data analysis

**Fiction Writer:**
- Exploring prompt engineering techniques to make AI write with emotional depth and academic rigor
